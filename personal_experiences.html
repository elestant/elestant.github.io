                <div class="mb-4">
                    <h3 class="mb-0"> History </h3>
                </div>
                <p class="lead mb-4">Bouaké is the second-largest city in Côte d'Ivoire, located in the central part of the country, with a population of 740,000 (2021 census). The area was originally inhabited by the Baoulé people, an Akan ethnic group that migrated from present-day Ghana in the 18th century. The city's name is believed to come from a <b>Baoulé village that predated colonial influence</b> .</p>

                <p class="lead mb-4">Bouaké began to develop significantly during the French colonial period in the early 20th century. Soon the French established a military post in the area, which soon became a <b>hub for trade and administration</b>. Its strategic location along the Abidjan-Niger railway, completed in the 1930s, connected Bouaké to the southern port of Abidjan and the northern regions of the country, fostering its growth as a commercial and industrial center.</p>

                <p class="lead mb-4">As the largest city in central Côte d’Ivoire, Bouaké plays a vital role in the national economy. It is a <b>key center for agricultural trade</b>, particularly in <b>cotton, cashew nuts, yams, and maize</b>. The surrounding region produces much of the country's cotton, and Bouaké hosts several <b>cotton ginning factories</b> and <b>textile plants</b>. Cashew nut processing is also a growing industry, supporting local employment and export revenue. </p>

                <p class="lead mb-4">In addition to agriculture, Bouaké has a well-developed <b>livestock market</b>, with cattle and other livestock brought from northern Côte d’Ivoire, Mali, and Burkina Faso. The city’s central market serves as a distribution hub for manufactured goods and food products heading to rural areas. Bouaké's location makes it a crossroads for <b>wholesale trade</b> between the north and south of the country.</p>

                <p class="lead mb-4">Since the early 2000s, Bouaké has also seen growth in the <b>service sector</b>, including education, banking, healthcare, and transportation. The city is home to universities and technical colleges that support the local labor force and attract students from across the region.</p>

                <p class="lead mb-4">In the early 2000s, Bouaké was heavily affected by the Ivorian civil conflict. From 2002 to 2011, it served as the de facto capital of the rebel-held north and experienced political instability, economic disruption, and a significant military presence. Despite these challenges, Bouaké has remained a resilient city and an important <b>cultural and economic hub</b>.</p>

                    <h3 class="mb-0"> The Retailer Project </h3>
                </div>

                <p class="lead mb-4">As I was living in Abidjan for almost two years before starting my PhD, one of my favorite activities was to go grocery shopping in the <b>informal marketplaces</b> and see what was the freshest fruit and vegetable in season. Through these repeated interactions, I began to connect with the <b>retailers</b> I regularly bought from. We talked about <b>the prices of goods</b>, where they were sourced, and the <b>challenges of making a living by selling small quantities</b> at the lowest possible prices. Many of these retailers told me that most vegetables were either from or coming through <b>Bouaké</b>, where, according to them, <b>"everyone was a trader of something."</b> Intrigued by this, I decided to visit Bouaké and see for myself.</p>

                <p class="lead mb-4">Bouaké is a city that has seen its share of challenges, especially during the <b>civil conflict in the early 2000s</b>. However, it has also been a place of <b>resilience and economic adaptation</b>. The local economy is largely <b>informal</b>, with countless small retailers selling goods in markets and on the streets. To better understand the city, I met with <b>Jackson Hien</b>, a PhD student in sociology at <b>Université Alassane Ouattara</b> in Bouaké. He showed me around and introduced me to the retailer from whom he regularly bought his food. We learned how each of the city's <b>15 marketplaces</b> had its own unique <b>identity and reputation</b>. More surprisingly, we discovered that there was only <b>one wholesale market</b> where nearly all the fruits and vegetables produced in the <b>Vallée du Bandama</b> region were gathered before being distributed to the different selling points around the city.</p>

                <p class="lead mb-4">Quickly, we both began to wonder why retailers didn’t at least <b>share transportation costs</b> to go to the wholesale market together. The answer remained vague. Surprisingly, all the retailers agreed that this would be a great idea—but that <b>no one was stepping up to organize it</b> and facilitate the implementation of such a change.</p>

                <p class="lead mb-4">From there, it became clear that <b>something could be done to improve the sourcing side of these small businesses</b>. We began piloting different ways of <b>cooperating</b>, based on the retailers' suggestions, and eventually converged on a solution that retailers found practical and effective. The implementation was simple enough to scale across <b>12 markets</b> in the surrounding neighborhoods, covering around <b>750 retailers out of the 1,000</b> we had previously identified.</p>
